## What is Meteor Up?

Meteor Up is a production quality application to deploy your Meteor App to anywhere.
Normally you can only deploy your meteor application to Meteor's own Galaxy cloud
servers. However with Meteor Up (MUP) you can deploy it to AWS, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean,
Azure, or any other place you can run an Ubuntu server.

## How easy is it?

Really Easy!!! You setup your config file and then just run a few commands.

`mup setup` and then `mup deploy` and boom! You're site is up. Assuming you did your 
config file right that is.

## Where can I find out more info?

The website of course! You can find it [here - home page](http://meteor-up.com).

The getting started tutorial can be found [here - getting started](http://meteor-up.com/getting-started.html).
