You may have or may not have noticed that you got redirected to this site from unrestrictedcoding.com. I feel as though UC became a dead project and wasn't getting the respect it diserved. So I have created this new site to start fresh.

The home page is a simple listing of projects, and I'll have a blog here on the `/blog/` page. That's about it. Other projects I create will be linked from here as it grows.

One of the first projects I am working on is a complete rewrite of an editor I created a few years ago. This time I'll be doing it right using Angular 4 and the newest products of Firebase.

Keep an eye open for new blog posts!
